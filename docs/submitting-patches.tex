\subsection{How to contribute}
CShoreWrt is constantly being improved.  We'd like as many people to contribute
to this as we can get. If you find a change useful, by all means try to get
it incorporated into the project. This should improve CShoreWrt and it should
help carry your changes forward into future versions

This section tries to lay out a procedure to enable people to submit patches
in a way that is most effective for all concerned.

It is important to do all these steps repeatedly:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{listen} to what other people think.
	\item \textit{talk} explaining what problem you are addressing and your
		proposed solution.
	\item \textit{do} write useful patches including documentation.
    \item \textit{test. test. test.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Where to listen and talk}

\begin{itemize}
	\item google openwrt, lede, and cshorewrt to find things related to your problem
	\item Wiki: check the wiki: \href{http://sourceforge.net/p/cshorewrt/wiki/Home/}{https://sourceforge.net/p/cshorewrt/wiki/Home/}
	\item Discuss: \href{https://sourceforge.net/p/cshorewrt/discussion/}{https://sourceforge.net/p/cshorewrt/discussion/}
	\item Bugs: \href{https://sourceforge.net/p/cshorewrt/tickets/}{https://sourceforge.net/p/cshorewrt/tickets}
	\item Blog: \href{https://sourceforge.net/p/cshorewrt/blog/}{https://sourceforge.net/p/cshorewrt/blog/}
\end{itemize}

It is often best to document what you are doing before you do it.  The process
of documentation often exposes possible improvements.  Keep your documentation
up to date.
