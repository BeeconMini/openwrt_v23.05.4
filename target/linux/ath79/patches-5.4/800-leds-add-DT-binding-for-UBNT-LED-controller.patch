+* Ubiquiti Aircube LED Device Driver.
+
+The driver can be used for controllers with a very simple serial protocol:
+- one LED is controlled by a single byte on MOSI
+- the value of the byte gives the brightness between two values (lowest to
+  highest)
+
+The value for lowest and highest brightness is dependent on the device and
+therefore on the compatible string.
+
+Depending on the compatible string some special functions (like hardware
+accelerated blinking) might can be supported too.
+
+Required properties:
+ - compatible: should be set to "ubnt,acb-leds"
+ - address-cells : Must be 1
+ - size-cells : Must be 0
+
+ - gpio-sck: GPIO spec for the SCK line to use
+ - gpio-mosi: GPIO spec for the MOSI line to use
+ - gpio-cs: GPIO to use for chipselect lines
+ 
+Each led is represented as a child node of the ubnt,acb-leds that
+describes the initial behavior for each LED physically and currently only one
+LED child nodes can be supported.
+
+Required properties for the LED child node:
+- label : See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
+- linux,default-trigger : See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
+- default-state: See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
+		Only "on" and "off" are supported.
+
+Example:
+
+	led-controller {
+		compatible = "ubnt,acb-leds";
+		#address-cells = <1>;
+		#size-cells = <0>;
+
+		sck-gpios = <&gpio 11 0>;
+		mosi-gpios = <&gpio 15 0>;
+		cs-gpios = <&gpio 14 0>;
+
+		led@0 {
+			reg = <0>;
+			label = "ubnt:white:status";
+			default-state = "on";
+		};
+	};
